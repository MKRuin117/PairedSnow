                    what places are safe to go, and much more. Bring evidence of this training to your interview (i.e: a certificate or degree).
                    Your job is to keep the trails and courses as safe as possible.

                    Cleaning, low-risk maintainance and other mundane tasks are all part of the job. Don't worry, though, you'll be accompanied by at least
                    one other person and will never be sent out on your own due to company policy.

                <em>Regulations</em>
                <p>As a maintainance worker, you have various items that can be used to temporarily seal off unsafe areas. If you deem an area unsafe, you can use light posts,
                    caution tape and signs to warn hikers and skiiers not to go there. If you think a course needs to be closed for maintainance, please contact a superior.
